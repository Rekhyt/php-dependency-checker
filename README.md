[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rekhyt/php-dependency-checker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rekhyt/php-dependency-checker)

A CLI tool to check your PHP project's dependencies for known security flaws.

## How Does It Work?
Currently, very simple: It will take your composer.lock file, send it to https://security.sensiolabs.org/check_lock
and present the results.

For build & deployment integration it will exit with an exit code of
* 0 if no vulnerabilities were found
* 1 if vulnerabilities found.

To be able to build even if your dependencies have vulnerabilities that don't affect your project (flawed code not used)
or there is no update, yet, an exception list can be defined.

For more information about how that API is working, refer to
https://github.com/sensiolabs/security-checker.

## Installation
The easiest way is to download the ready-to-use PHAR from the
[releases page](https://github.com/Rekhyt/php-dependency-checker/releases).

### Install As Dependency
To have this as a dependency in your project require it via composer:

    composer require rekhyt/php-dependency-checker

## Usage
### CLI Tool
Pass the path to your composer.lock file (NOT composer.json). Pass the optional --exclude-from parameter with the path
to a file that contains the exceptions.

    ./php-dependency-checker --exclude-from exclusion-list composer.lock

### In Your Code
to be done

## Package Exception List Format
Put one package per line as referenced in composer.json:

    phpmailer/phpmailer
    psr/log
    psr/cache
